## ThineDesign
An attempt to put my skills to the test in the creation of my first 3D game. This is
mostly just meant to be an outlet to extend my knowledge into another area of programming.
However, as a Christian, I do like the idea of a Minecraft clone that is just as functional
as Minecraft, but at the same time does not include all the occultish and demonic stuff in
Minecraft. Such as enchanting, potions and witches, the nether or hell among other things.

### Dependencies
Install dependencies by running `v install` in the cloned repo (the directory containing the v.mod file).

### TODO
Not an exhaustive list and in no particular order:
- TOP PRIORITY: Render chunks with VBO/VAO instead of glBegin & glEnd.
- Infinite worlds
- HUD
- Inventory
- Make it so a headless server can be run
- Multiplayer
